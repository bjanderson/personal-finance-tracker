# Personal Finance Tracker

The secret to having good personal financial health is to simply keep track of where your money is, where it comes from, and where it goes to.
This is a spreadsheet document designed to help you do just that.

This document contains macros that help you set up spreadsheets for each of your accounts.
The macros are mostly just focused on stamping out the templates and setting up the formulas.
Once you understand how everything works, you can easily modify everything however you want to.

Let's get you started with your own copy of the document.

## Installation

### Install LibreOffice

First you will need to install LibreOffice, if you don't already have it.

Go to https://www.libreoffice.org/download/, and download the latest version of LibreOffice for your device.
They have [helpful documentation](https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/) if you need help figuring out how to get LibreOffice installed.

### Download The Document

Next you will need to download a copy of the document.

But before you download it I recommend creating a folder where you will keep the document from now on. Coming up, we will set up permissions for LibreOffice to run macros in this folder, so create a folder that will be dedicated to holding this document.

To get a copy of the document go to the project on my Github page at https://github.com/bjanderson/personal-finance-tracker/.

You can either download all the files in the project by clicking on the Code button and selecting Download ZIP, or you can click on the [personal-finance-tracker.ods](https://github.com/bjanderson/personal-finance-tracker/raw/master/personal-finance-tracker.ods) file and select any of the View raw, Raw, or Download buttons. This will prompt you to save the file and you can save it in the folder you created in the previous step.

### Enable Macros

Now go ahead and open the document.

When you open it for the first time you will get a warning that the document contains macros, and it will tell you where you can find the settings to change the macro security settings.

Take note of where the warning pointed you to, click OK, and go to that menu.

I run Linux, so I will click Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Security > Macro Security.

On Mac you will need to click LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice > Security > Macro Security.

If you need help finding this menu, check the [documentation](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/optionen/01030300.html?DbPAR=SHARED#bm_id2322153).

In the Macro Security dialog click on the Trusted Sources tab.

In the Trusted File Locations section click the Add button.

Choose the folder that you created at the beginning to hold this document, and click OK to close the dialog windows.

Now close the document and re-open it so the macro security settings take effect. When you open it this time you should not see the macro security warning. If you do see the warning, make sure you have this document saved in the same folder that you added to the Trusted File Locations.
